* This is a mobile application built using React Native, which provides a platform for job seekers to search for jobs and apply for them. The application uses various features to enhance the user experience, such as popular and nearby jobs, as well as job types like part-time, full-time, and contractor jobs.

* Fetch data from an external API and integrate it

* Create customAPI data fetching hooks
* Write clean, organized, and maintainable code with proper architecture
* Follow the best practices for React Native development
